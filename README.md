# Happy Thoughts
The assignment was to create a "twitter look a like" where you can add and like comments. Likes should be counted and listed in chronological order (newest comments on top). Also, the design should be similar to instructon example.

## The problem
I enjoyed this task though it was challening and difficult knowing what's going on sometimes. Although, due to a lot of errors I had (caused by misplaced bracket) I learnt a lot.
